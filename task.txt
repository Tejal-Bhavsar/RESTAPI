create a REST API -JSON

its good practise to make a hybrid server that can be used by both web and mobile, alexa etc
1. Get/users  = web - returns html (SSR)
2 Get/api/users = mobile, alexa etc - returns json()
Get/users = list all users ()


Get/users/1 = user wid ID 1

Post/user = create new user

PATCHT/user/1 = edit user wid ID 1

Delete/user/1 = delete user wid id 1
